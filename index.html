        <p>The Seven Sisters is a mountain range in Alstahaug municipality in Nordland. The seven mountain peaks are from the
          south Breitind (also called Stortind), Kvasstind, Tvillingan (twins), Skjæringen, Grytfoten and Botnkrona.</p>
        <p>Botnkrona is the highest of the mountain peaks with its 1072 metres.</p>
        <p>In the south you will find Alstahaug, where the famous poet-priest Petter Dass worked. The small town of Sandnessjøen
          is located in the very north of the mountain range.</p> 
        <p>I myself come from a small place called Søroffersøy, which is behind Breitind. Breitind is also the only one of the mountain peaks that I have climbed.</p>
